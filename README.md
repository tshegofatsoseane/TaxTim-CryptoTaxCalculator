## 6. Architecture notes

- All tax logic lives in:
  ```
  backend/app/Services/CryptoTax/
  ```
- No database required
- Backend is stateless and deterministic
- Frontend only renders results

## 6. Disclaimer

This tool assists with crypto tax calculations but does not replace professional tax advice.  
Final responsibility remains with the taxpayer.
